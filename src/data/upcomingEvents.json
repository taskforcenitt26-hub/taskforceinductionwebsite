    "description": "Before the official induction process for Deputy Managers begins, TaskForce conducts the Pre-Induction Task. In this initiative, our second-year members actively assist first-year students joining NIT Trichy by guiding them through the hostel allotment process and helping them settle in smoothly. This hands-on experience not only supports newcomers but also fosters leadership and responsibility among our members."

    "description": "From forgotten sheds to fresh rides â€” RECycle breathes new life into abandoned bicycles on campus. Each year, cycles left behind in hostel sheds by graduating students are collected by our team, refurbished in partnership with trusted vendors, and made safe and road-ready. These renewed cycles are then sold at affordable prices to incoming freshers during orientation, ensuring they have a reliable and eco-friendly way to get around campus from day one."
